# Rolling stone wants to make a special number for the last 100 years of music 
# The magazine will contain some analysis for 5 different decades (20-49, 50-79, 80-99, 00-09, 10-20)
# UNIVARIATE IDEAS:
# - let's find the major shifts in music
# box plot for different decades but same variables put together
# cross of skeweness for shifting trends, kurtosis for convegences
# ... <----------
# MULTIVARIATE IDEAS:
# - search for evergreen correlations ()
# ... <----------
# AT THE END..
# - After that, it would be cool have the mean of the variables each year every year plotted with an explanation
# - max popularity artist
# - max popularity song
